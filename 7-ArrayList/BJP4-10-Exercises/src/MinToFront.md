## BJP4 Exercise 10.6: minToFront
#### Author:Marty Stepp (on 2016/09/08)

Write a method minToFront that takes an ArrayList of integers as a parameter and that moves the minimum value in the list to the front, otherwise preserving the order of the elements. For example, if a variable called list stores the following values: `{3, 8, 92, 4, 2, 17, 9}` and you make this call: minToFront(list); it should store the following values after the call: `{2, 3, 8, 92, 4, 17, 9}` You may assume that the list stores at least one value.
