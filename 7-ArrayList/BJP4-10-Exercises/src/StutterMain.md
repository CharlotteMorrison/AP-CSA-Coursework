## BJP4 Exercise 10.11: stutter
#### Author:Marty Stepp (on 2016/09/08)

Write a method stutter that takes an ArrayList of Strings and an integer k as parameters and that replaces every string with k copies of that string. For example, if the list stores the values `["how", "are", "you?"]` before the method is called and k is 4, it should store the values `["how", "how", "how", "how", "are", "are", "are", "are", "you?", "you?",` "you?", "you?"] after the method finishes executing. If k is 0 or negative, the list should be empty after the call.
