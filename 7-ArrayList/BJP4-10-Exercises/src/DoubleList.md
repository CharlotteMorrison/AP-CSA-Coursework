## BJP4 Exercise 10.4: doubleList
#### Author:Marty Stepp (on 2016/09/08)

Write a method doubleList that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter and that replaces every string with two of that string. For example, if the list stores the values `{"how", "are", "you?"}` before the method is called, it should store the values `{"how", "how", "are", "are", "you?", "you?"}` after the method finishes executing.
